Admin view of what shows/movies can be deleted from the server based on watch history

Sharing a Jellyfin library with others? Have limited space? Need to delete content, but tired of hearing users complain the show they weren't done with is "gone"? 

This tool lets you check one or more user's watch history to find what's been watched by whom to quickly identify what shows and movies can be safely deleted.
